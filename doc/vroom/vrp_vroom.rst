Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VROOM is an open-source optimization engine that aims at providing good solutions
to various real-life vehicle routing problems (VRP) within a small computing time.

VROOM can solve several well-known types of vehicle routing problems (VRP).

- TSP (travelling salesman problem)
- CVRP (capacitated VRP)
- VRPTW (VRP with time windows)
- MDHVRPTW (multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle VRPTW)
- PDPTW (pickup-and-delivery problem with TW)

VROOM can also solve any mix of the above problem types.


Characteristics
...............................................................................

VROOM models a Vehicle Routing Problem with ``vehicles``, ``jobs`` and ``shipments``.

The **vehicles** denote the resources that pick and/or deliver the jobs and shipments.
They are characterised by:

- Capacity on arbitrary number of metrics
- Skills
- Working hours
- Driver breaks
- Start and end defined on a per-vehicle basis
- Start and end can be different
- Open trip optimization (only start or only end defined)

The **jobs** denote the single-location pickup and/or delivery tasks, and the **shipments**
denote the pickup-and-delivery tasks that should happen within the same route.
They are characterised by:

- Delivery/pickup amounts on arbitrary number of metrics
- Service time windows
- Service duration
- Skills
- Priority

Terminologies
...............................................................................

- **Tasks**: Either jobs or shipments are referred to as tasks.
- **Skills**: Every task and vehicle may have some set of skills. A task can be served by only that vehicle which has all the skills of the task.
- **Priority**: Tasks may have some priority assigned, which is useful when all tasks cannot be performed due to constraints, so the tasks with low priority are left unassigned.
- **Amount (for shipment), Pickup and delivery (for job)**: They denote the multidimensional quantities such as number of items, weights, volume, etc.
- **Capacity (for vehicle)**: Every vehicle may have some capacity, denoting the multidimensional quantities. A vehicle can serve only those sets of tasks such that the total sum of the quantity does not exceed the vehicle capacity, at any point of the route.
- **Time Window**: An interval of time during which some activity can be performed, such as working hours of the vehicle, break of the vehicle, or service start time for a task.
- **Break**: Array of time windows, denoting valid slots for the break start of a vehicle.
- **Service time**: The additional time to be spent by a vehicle while serving a task.
- **Travel time**: The total time the vehicle travels during its route.
- **Waiting time**: The total time the vehicle is idle, i.e. it is neither traveling nor servicing any task. It is generally the time spent by a vehicle waiting for a task service to open.

Optional Parameters
...............................................................................

=================== =========== =========================== =================================================
Parameter           Type        Default                     Description
=================== =========== =========================== =================================================
**plan**            ``BOOLEAN`` ``false``                   When ``true``, plan mode is enabled. Choose ETA for
                                                            custom routes and report violations. Requires GLPK as a dependency.

                                                            - All constraints in input implicitly become soft constraints.
                                                            - The output is a set of routes matching the expected description while minimizing timing violations and reporting all constraint violations.

**Note**:

- At least one of the start_index or end_index shall be present.
- If end_index is omitted, the resulting route will stop at the last visited task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process
- If start_index is omitted, the resulting route will start at the first visited task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process
- To request a round trip, specify both start_index and end_index with the same index.
- A vehicle is only allowed to serve a set of tasks if the resulting load at each route step is lower than the matching value in capacity for each metric. When using multiple components for amounts, it is recommended to put the most important/limiting metrics first.
- It is assumed that all delivery-related amounts for jobs are loaded at vehicle start, while all pickup-related amounts for jobs are brought back at vehicle end.

Time Windows SQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``SELECT`` statement that returns the following columns:

::

    start_time, end_time

====================  ====================================== ================================================
Column                Type                                   Description
====================  ====================================== ================================================
**start_time**        ``INTEGER``                             Start time of the time window.

**end_time**          ``INTEGER``                             End time of the time window.
====================  ====================================== ================================================

**Note**:

- All timing are in seconds.
- Every row must satisfy the condition: :code:`start_time â‰¤ end_time`.
- It is up to users to decide how to describe time windows:

  - **Relative values**, e.g. [0, 14400] for a 4 hours time window starting at the beginning of the planning horizon. In that case all times reported in output with the arrival column are relative to the start of the planning horizon.
  - **Absolute values**, "real" timestamps. In that case all times reported in output with the arrival column can be interpreted as timestamps.
